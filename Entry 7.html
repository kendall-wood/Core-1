		I hope this all isn’t too much for you. I understand that these entries aren’t the most organized, it’s mentally taxing to find the connections between them. I get that. To be honest it’s all intentional. I could say that I’m trying to make you guys think or I’m taking you on a journey but it’s all just an effort towards empathy to me. I think I want people to feel what I feel not to know what I feel. I don’t believe people can care about what I have going on nearly as much as they can care about how that empathy feels. It’s just as personal for you as it is for me. This confusion is something I can’t write down. I can’t draw it I can’t design it. I have to make experiences that mirror the way my brain felt in other experiences. A new slate for us both to experience in reference to the one that only I know. Maybe you never grasp anything I’m saying and that’s ok. I just feel like this practice of piecing together these fragments of understandings and emotions is like gospel for me. I just hope this isn’t too taxing for you all. I’m sorry for confusing anyone I have. Just continue to experience it if you choose. <br>
