		BLUE
	</p2>
	<p>
		They ask me all the time,
		Why blue?
		To be honest it’s not as overcomplicated as I could make it.
		It’s largely intuitive as I feel most of my work is.<br>
		<br>
		I think it’s beautiful that I’m pursuing my therapy as a profession.
		I think if you look at my work as therapy it’ll provide a needed context as to why I’m explaining things the way I am<br>
		<br>
		For a long time I truly just wanted to make people feel what I felt.
		I don’t know why I felt so isolated in my emotions to be honest.
		I don’t think what I feel is that complex, 
		Everyone deals with grief and isolation in different ways.<br>
		<br>
		Blue is healing to me.
		Blue is baby blue.
		I think I’m trying to heal younger me.
		That’s why everything I make is so personal.
		There’s a privilege within boyhood that actually makes me insane.
		I understand how valuable representation is because of my own idolatry.
		I love a ben Franklin story.
		I love a Peter Parker arc.
		There’s just something beautiful about the stories I’ve grown up idolizing.
		The West, masculinity, power, money, these things all fascinate me.
		The consequences of privilege are everything to me.
		Systems of oppression and suppression and inequality ultimately hurt the perpetuating party as well.
		On a smaller scale I am my own worst enemy, as systems of oppression can be in themselves.
		Its all I think about.
		I have a problem with indulgence and I reckon with that by hoping to create opportunities for others with wealth.
		A radical selflessness that blossoms from validating any insecurities that fuel my mission.
		I’m trying to feel things that I don’t think I let myself feel.
		Or things I don’t even know im feeling.
		Feeling to me is just as much mental as physical.<br>
		<br>
		Blue is angelic.
		It’s water.
		I always see things in this light blue.
		There’s something soft about it.
		Something pure.
		I love contradiction.<br>
		<br>
		I truly feel like I’ve bet my life on this idea of expressing these ideas.
		Not specifically the blue itself,
		But what it means to me.
		I’ve bet my whole life on hoping that people will take this journey with me.
		I think from a commercial focus I’m a valuable source of vulnerability.
		I think people are trying to capture authenticity inauthentically. 
		I kinda let everything happen as it does.<br>
		<br>
		I think blue is a state of focus for me.
		Its a refinement.
		Its rejecting the manic and uncontrolled impulses from my youth that brought me to where I am today.
		Its rejecting that battery in my back.
		I don’t want to make art from a place of trauma anymore.
		Im tired of trying to make people see things as I see them and feel things as I feel them.
		That’s neither my responsibility nor theirs to build that connection.
		I want to create expressions from a place of refined thought.
		Meditated emotions.
		I have to work backwards.
		Or forwards maybe.
		Once I heal younger me I think I’ll get everything I want.<br>
		<br>
		I ramble. And I’m sorry. But this is what healing looks like for me. This is the headspace I’m inviting you in to.<br>
		<br>
		But there’s healing that must take place and can’t be avoided.
		That’s why blue. <br>
